    "title": "Coming Apart: How Lost Connection Causes a Crisis of Meaning",
    "body": "2019/12/31 - Foreword: This essay is one that I wrote this past month for my AP Seminar class. I have updated it for less academic audiences. Hopefully, this essay will be the first of many that I start writing and publishing on this website. If you have any inquiries or suggestions to topics I could cover, email me at tyler. devtcn@gmail. com. In his famous poetry book “Looking for the Gulf Motel,” Richard Blanco describes the loss of his parents and the connection that he shared with them, one bound by memories and sensations. In much the same way, people around the world are suffering from a loss of human connection. As humans evolve, we increasingly find ourselves isolated from each other, our eyes glued to a new, digitized reality that serves as a substitute for the one around us. This retraction into ourselves happens regardless of class, political party, or nationality. At this point in time, many still argue over the causes of this retraction, with each side reflexively claiming the other is the unequivocal force to blame for the issue at hand. Some spend their time attempting to downplay this issue as nothing more than the complaints of a vocal few. Taking these factors into account, I carefully investigated the different schools of thought on this issue. That way, I was able to get a more holistic view of this issue then I could otherwise have. From my research, I have concluded that the loss of human connection is the result of a crisis of meaning, one exacerbated by the loss of meaning-making structures, technological consumption, and the death of the family structure. This crisis threatens our human connections by destabilizing our society and destroying the lives of the people that live in it, creating a vicious cycle. Deteriorating Connection: Human connection, that is to say the summation of our relationships with, memories of, and emotions about other people, is in a state of serious decline. As data-gathering organizations like Pew Research Center have noted, an increasing number of Americans know very few of their neighbors, with a significant number of people knowing none of them [1]. This goes along with a larger trend of people who, simply put, do not trust the people in their social circles. As enrolled in some of the most competitive majors to date, it is understandable that those who study the health sciences are subjected to a more stressful experience than those who choose to major in other fields. Despite this fact, a research paper for the American Journal of Pharmaceutical Education by four post-doctoral students found in their survey of thousands of health science students, one-fifth of them experience social isolation [2]. In addition, competition with others was seen as a barrier to socialization, due to the endemic distrust among students [2]. While this case does consist of those at the top of the academic strata, the elements of a deteriorating human connection, particularly those of social isolation, are present not just in our relationships with our neighbors, but our trust with other people broadly. In addition, a 2018 study of over 20,000 Americans published in the American Journal of Health Promotion found nearly half of Americans feel lonely, with two in five Americans saying that their relationships have no meaning at all [3]. This trend of social isolation found in the health sciences is found, to a higher degree, in society overall, indicating a more widespread phenomenon. By taking all of this into account, the fact that isolation and the loss of social connection cut across all variations of Americans truly points to a decline in our society as a whole. Most people may agree that there is a loss of human connection in society today, but many dispute the cause of it. However, widely-published behavioral scientist and psychology professor Clay Routledge contends that a crisis of meaning make far more sense and pushes out these other causes, usually pointed to as automation or the decline in religious attitudes. In his article published in the online academic magazine Quillette entitled “Meaning Matters,” Routledge points out that all the signs of a decline in human connection line up with a crisis of meaning. As he puts it, “The more people feel strongly connected to others, the more they perceive life as meaningful. Social exclusion, ostracism, and loneliness all lead to feelings of meaninglessness” [4]. Relying on his own research into meaning, Routledge argues that feeling like a burden on other people puts one on at a high risk of suicide, in part because it leads to meaninglessness. The theme of lost meaning is consistent with the findings presented previously, which found that many Americans find their relationships with others meaningless [3]. The intricate mixture of meaninglessness and social connection, coupled with Routledge’s tying of loneliness to a crisis of meaning, bolsters the notion that society is suffering from such a crisis. Underlying Causes of the Crisis: Beyond establishing the existence of the crisis of meaning, it is also imperative to understand what could cause such a complex issue as it. The loss of religiosity in the world, that is to say the lack of strong religious feelings, is often said to be the cause of this crisis, and with good reason. Churches are essentially small communities that people can join, form friendships, and create social bonds with others. In “Meaning Matters,” Clay Routledge points out that religion does not just provide community, but a meaning-making structure, mainly the imposition of social duties onto an adherent for them to act out. As he puts it, understanding the psychology of religion, perhaps without adhering to any, can help one understand the meaning in their life [4]. This is commensurate with the observable truth that, as noted by Pew Research Center, people who are actively religious are far more likely to be happy than their secular counterparts [5]. The broad domain of this survey shows that across cultures, there is a noted communal benefit to being religious. Unfortunately, this positive correlation is countered by a negative trend. According to America’s Changing Religious Identity, a report published by the nonpartisan Public Religion Research Institute, the number of Americans who identify as religious is going down fast [6]. This fact, while not causally related to the loss of human connection, is a convenient occurence that seems to increase the likelihood of something going wrong. With social isolation and meaninglessness at an all time high, the lack of religiosity appears to contribute to this issue, with an examination of religious values that Routledge suggests being a possible solution. Another place many seek to place the blame onto is technological consumption, a category that amounts to an amalgamation of smartphones, too much screen time, and too many video games. Partially, this is true. According to a paper published in the American Journal for Preventative Medicine by nine researchers from the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine of the 2,000 young adults who completed the survey provided those who used social media more perceived themselves as socially isolated at a much higher rate than those who use less social media [7]. The finding of social media as a cause of social isolation points to a more nuanced reality on technological consumption: the issue is not the technology itself, but the way in which it is used. In the case of social media, a well intentioned platform for connecting the world has transformed into yet another way to isolate people into arbitrary groups, where all the nuance and emotion of physical conversation is instead compressed into pixelated characters and images. Despite this, some argue that technology is used to unite us. An instance of this would be a speech titled “Gaming can make a better world” given by Jane McGonigal, an author who holds a Ph. D. in performance studies, on how online activities, and more specifically games, can be designed to unite us. She cites widely popular, collaborative games like World of Warcraft as a model for how to solve problems and, as the title of her talk states, create a better world [8]. Some like McGonigal may argue that technology is used to connect us, and although the idea has merit, the truth is the opposite. As with most things that are left up to the free market, those who develop technology like games will sacrifice the social connections a product could have for the profit it will create. In this way, the manner in which technology is used and created are contributing factors in the continual social isolation, and crisis of meaning, that we face. An additional cause of this crisis of meaning is the breakdown of the family structure, mainly due to the physical isolation people are experiencing in tandem with their digital isolation. This is evident in the conclusions of widely-published social scientist Neil Howe in “Millennials And The Loneliness Epidemic. ” In this Forbes article, Howe points out that single-person households are on the rise, now making up the second-most common household type as well as doubling in number over the past 50 years [9]. By physically isolating ourselves, we deprive ourselves of the most important source of meaning we can ever have: other people. This not only happens in the single person realm, but the marital realm as well. As noted by Pew Social Trends, the number of two-parent households is in serious decline, falling over 18% in the past 50 years, with the number of single-parent households rising fast [10]. In addition to affecting developed adults, physical isolation has severely impacted young children, children who rely on their parents to teach them to create connection with other people. In short, the physical deprivation of meaning, coupled with the digital isolation we face, is extremely detrimental to the human connections we need to forge. Effects: At the end of the day, the question still remains: Why does any of this matter? Such a question is incredibly important, and careful examination shows that the effects of such a deterioration of social connections is incredibly devastating. In an academic paper published in the research Psychiatry Research by two researchers at the Department of Psychology in George Mason University, a survey of people found that not living a meaningful life was directly tied to a large risk factor for suicide [11]. This falls in line with the larger pattern described in the paper, where the suicide rate across countries is skyrocketing [11]. In short, the loss of human connection leads, and has led, to a mass suicide epidemic that will destroy our society. Another important thing to consider is the cycle that these causes propagate, which further destroys the social fabric. Physical isolation leads to less participation in group activities like churchgoing, and lack of churchgoing leads to a deprivation of meaning, which leads to loneliness and then suicide. All of these things feed into each other and the cycle that they create slowly chips away at our society, increasing the rate of suicides and destroying the social connections that we forge. Given the overlapping phenomena such as increased loneliness, more suicide, and much more social withdrawl, there is a definite link between a crisis of meaning and the loss of human connection. While many are quick to dismiss this issue, the many consequences of ignoring such an issue should be reason enough to warrant an investigation. Understanding the root causes behind such a devastating force to society as this can help everyone find a solution that can fix the ties that bind us together. Only together can we solve the issues that split us apart. References: "

    "body": "2019/12/23 - This summer, I had the opportunity to intern at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, specifically in the Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility (OLCF). My primary goal was to assist in the creation of a project to show the benefits of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) to the broader community. I worked on this project with my good friend Logan O’Neal. About The Project: The impetus for this project arose from the desire to update Tiny Titan, an open source computing project developed by ORNL a few years ago. Tiny Titan consists of a stack of Raspberry Pis that run in parallel a fluid simulation, with each doing a separate task to contribute to the whole. When thinking about how we could update it, the idea of using a GPU came up. Last year, we built a test model named Simple Summit, an array of six NVIDIA Jetson TX2s. To continue that project this year, we decided to take in a different direction. We switched cooling solutions, adding the ability to demonstrate a cooling system other than air, which fit in well with the supercomputer Summit. (Summit has a massive water-cooling loop) We initially thought about a water cooling system, but after much deliberation we decided to take it up to the next level. We created a system of two-phase immersion cooling. What is immersion cooling?: Immersion cooling is a cooling method of dipping your electronics in a non-conductive dielectric fluid. This method has been around for a while, but has gained some traction due to the innovations in two-phase technology. A two-phase immersion cooling system is unique in that it contains a mechanism to condense the dielectric fluid when it evaporates, allowing the load to be turned up to a higher degree. What did I do?: In the production of the project, Logan and I wrote the software that would run on the cluster. The software package, currently nicknamed “Leconte,” is a fully-functioning GUI application that contains three different simulations: a smoke particle demonstration, a particle simulation, and a machine-learning demo. I specialized in the GUI, which I wrote in C++ using Qt, a GUI framework. Much of my time was spent investigating the features of this library, which was unlike anything we had done before. Learning how GUI coding worked under the hood was very fascinating and very impactful on me. By the end, I felt somewhat comfortable with writing the GUI code. The full repository of the project can be found here. What’s next?: That remains to be seen for this project, but I want to continue to investigate the ways in which I can expand my skills in GUI design. I have been designing digital art for the past two years, and I want to integrate more and more with my programming work. "

    "body": "2019/03/19 - For the past few weeks, I have been thinking about pathfinding for our FIRST Robotics team. Specifically, I have been looking into how we could implement a form of spline-based autonomous onto our 2019 robot, Rosetta. There are many libraries available for FIRST teams to use. FIRST itself has added a PathWeaver application with their 2019 software package to allow us to visually generate trajectories for our robots. Jaci’s Pathfinder is a library that PathWeaver is based in that provided the necessary tools for generating speeds for the motors to go. In addition, many of the most successful teams, such as Team 254, the Cheezy Poofs, (Yes, that’s their actual name), use splines on their robots. However, Team 254 does many things that would be considered collegiate level, such as writing their own code library that interfaces the hardware directly, using hermetic splines, or calculating custom motion profiles with calculus. The average high schooler usually only begins to know Calculus in their senior year, so the knowledge gap is extremely large. The IdeaI had a brainwave as I was looking into this. What if there was a system that would generate a spline in realtime to a specific point on the field and cause the robot to follow them with some level of accuracy? The idea, at the highest level of stratification, can be split into two different sections:  The Calculation of the Robot Position on the Field (I will refer to it as Sub. 1) The Generation and Execution of a Trajectory (Sub. 2)This idea could be potential fodder for an Innovation Award in FIRST Robotics at competition, if done correctly. However, to fully execute this idea, I need to grasp the concept of a spline. Such a task will, in my estimation, stretch my mathematical ability to its limits. Splines A spline is a unique kind of interpolation. It is, in essence, a kind of polynomial piecewise function, where a polynomial is drawn between two points for a group of points. Unlike regression, which uses a single function, spline interpolation is a system that avoids overfitting due to its complex nature. How does it create a smooth graph? Well, two polynomials who share a common point must meet a myriad of requirements, one important one being that the derivatives of the two at that point must match. As it has been explained to me, a derivative is the instantaneous speed of a point on a curve. Since this a fundamental calculus principle, I am not currently equipped to calculate a derivative, something I hope to rectify. Where I Need To GoIn order to create this project, I need to expand my mathematical knowledge to encompass the realms of both Precalculus and basic Calculus. Since I am set up to take Precalculus next year, I will need to make significant headway during the summer. This will most likely consist of practicing with Khan Academy and worksheets I can find online. Furthermore, I need to reach out to the mentors on my Robotics team for advice and teaching on this area. They can add on to and remove from my project and make it the best it can be. I also will probably contract my best friend Logan O’Neal from Robotics to work with me, as well as Jackson Moody. This project will be a massive undertaking, one unlike anything I have done in my life before. I need to dedicate myself to this and work as efficently as possible. I am writing this to keep myself accountable, and I hope that those around me can keep myself accountable as well. "

I did not really have a system of keeping track of my assignments and upcoming events, mostly relying on my memory to do the trick. Lately, my memory had become overloaded with all the things going on: Robotics, CodeTN, NHS, the Internship opportunity, School, and my Personal Interests. That is when I came across the Bullet Journal. I was watching YouTube when I saw this video, and it got me interested. What Is Bullet Journal?Bullet Journal is a robust system of keeping notes that is very easy to use and enables for continual track of tasks throughout any given time period. (year, month, day, etc. ) The main thing that makes Bullet Journal work is its idea of Rapid Logging, a system where you use certain symbols to connote certain items and give a brief summary of them. In Rapid Logging, you go back over your tasks after a while and determine what is worth continuing. This aided by the tiered system of the Journal, beginning with a year overview and then breaking down into months. You go even further by keeping a Daily Log. How I Use Bullet JournalI began a Bullet Journal this past January, and have used it for all kinds of things, such as school and Robotics. It has worked out spectacularly. I have learned many things from using, not including that I need to practice better penmanship. It has helped me stress less about projects since I can plan their due date and work accordingly.  This is a photo of my monthly log for March. You may notice that the other page is also filled out, and it contains my goals for this month, with some general objectives that I aim to accomplish.  This photo is an example of both a monthly log and a daily log that I have done. The various symbols I use signify different things. The triangle is a school assignment and the unfilled bullet is an event. I may post more about my organization techniques, but I wish to close by saying that Bullet Journal has helped me tremendously in my daily life, and I highly recommend that you try it, too. Bullet Journal has an app that you can download on iOS or Android or a book you can read. "

    "body": "2019/03/02 - No matter what it looks like at first, Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice is more than meets the eye, a lesson you learn very quickly in the first cutscene as the game starts. From the intimate visuals to the visceral combat, this game stands out not only as an achievement in storytelling, but also in game design. Before I dive into this, I highly recommend that you go play this game. It is free on Xbox Game Pass, and 50% off on the Playstation and Steam stores now. Slight spoilers ahead.  Independent AAA: Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice was created by Ninja Theory, the studio known for games such as DmC: Devil May Cry and Heavenly Sword. While Ninja Theory made triple-A games, around 2013 they took a unique stance to project design. After realizing that the large market was favoring indie games over massive triple-A titles, they decided to go in between, developing what would become Hellblade as an “independent AAA” title. For information on “Independent AAA” games, see this blog post on Hellblade’s website. While this statement may seem paradoxical, it is more of a combination than a contradiction. AAA games have large budgets, hundreds of people, lots of marketing, and get to a high level of quality. Indie games are small, made by usually a group of friends, and are usually small-concept games. Tameem Antoniades, the head of Ninja Theory, sought to bridge the gap between the two. With a team of twenty developers, Ninja Theory worked for nearly four years before releasing it on PC in 2017.  Chronicles of Creation: One truly unique aspect of the development cycle of Hellblade was the openness the developers had with the community. Ninja Theory published 30 “Dev Diaries” over their development cycle, charting their course from the Gamescom reveal to the day of release. The problems they faced, the choices they made, and the creation of the game was on full display. At every stage, they turned to their community for help, whether it be for beta testing or jobs. In addition, the “Diaries” also showed the true ingenuity of these “indie” developers. Cutscenes and animations were motion-captured not in a high-end studio room with multiple cameras everywhere, but a temporary meeting room with cheap studio lights. Senua, modeled off of and acted by Melina Juergens, was created in an amalgamation of ways, ranging from using a Raspberry pi, a camera, and an LED ring to create multiple images of her face. The result is a character model that is polished beyond belief.  Not all innovations were made in character capture, but also in the overall design process. No idea was thrown out immediately, and every avenue was explored, creating a game that feels unique in every way. Different levels have different effects and mechanics that feel fleshed out. The combat is visceral, with every blow you land and receive making an impact, and the enemies make you feel small, something few games achieve successfully. Play It By Ear: By far, the most unique innovation in *Hellbladev is the use of sound. At first, this may seem like a misnomer, but it is one of the many things that sets this game apart. From the beginning, you are prompted to play this game with a headset, a move that makes a significant difference. See, Senua is not a normal protagonist. She isn’t alone in her own head. There are voices all around her, Furies that guide her through the world. They warn her of an incoming attack, hint at story elements, and more to create an atmosphere of ever-present unease.  Mental Shift: Senua is set apart from other gaming characters in that she is mentally ill, stricken with a form of psychosis that affects how she perceives the world. Her illness is deeply rooted in and affected by her backstory, one that we learn more about as the game unfolds. Ninja Theory took a big leap of faith, tackling one of the most controversial and underrepresented subjects in gaming: Mental Illness. Without diving too much into story, many dark places are explored, both literally and metaphorically, in ways that have never been seen before. The Future of Game Design?: I can gush all I want about this game, but Hellblade has come and gone, leaving a mark on the industry as a whole. It encourages small developers not only to go out of their comfort zone, but also appeals to triple-A studios to watch their step. As the future unfolds, it is appearing more and more that people are in the market for games like Hellblade, not the next Black Ops or sequel. One can look no further than the recent less-than-stellar reception of many titles, both critically and by consumers. Above all else, Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice is a call to adventure. You can do amazing things, if you put your mind to it. "

    "body": "2019/02/10 - What is CodeTN?: CodeTN Is an organization that hosts various computer programming opportunities around the world. You may or may not remember that they were behind the push to break the world record for the most people programming at the same time last year. In addition to this, they work closely with KnoxDevs and organize meetups. For more information, see their website. In addition to all this, CodeTN also sponsors a competition every year in which schools from around Knoxville create teams that create a “dynamic web application” that uses a database and helps the community. The Idea: Early on in 2017, we decided that we would help the community that deals with food allergies. People with allergies faces lots of challenges daily, including meal choice. As we thought more and more about it, we decided that we could do that by allowing people with food allergies to see what restaurants they could/could not go to. The Execution: This was my first excursion into somewhat-professional web development, so I didn’t know what exactly to do. Logan O’Neal and I looked over many libraries and decided on a couple. We used Mapbox to create the interactive map that was the basis for our application. We chose it because it was an alternative to Google Maps that had a lot more customizability. I was very impressed with the level of customization Mapbox allows in their Mapbox Studio. They let you color different parts of the map whatever you want, and add whatever image you wish to the map. In addition, we used fullPage. js for our front-end part of the website. The prospect of having customizable slides really seemed appealling and a good choice for a presentation of sorts. When we used it, it was mostly free, but as I look at the website now, it has become very priced. For the “mobile responsiveness,” we used Materialize. css. Our usage of this was mostly the pullout menu for the phones. The Reception: We went to the competition, and did not place. We were stationed in the Standard, a meeting place not far off from where the school is. Our presentation was shoddy, and as the night unfolded, we realized that we were not prepared nearly enough and that there was fundamental flaw in our idea. Retrospective (i. e. the criticism): What I will say in this is completely my fault, not the fault of the team. The biggest lesson I learned from this was the paradox of control. I wanted to be the end-all be-all for the team, and sacrificed any spark of creativity that I didn’t agree with. We underused and overused libraries that year. Materialize would have made an excellent front-end design, but I only used it for one thing. FullPage. js was a good idea, but in practice we did not have a clear brand vision for the site. It instead became an amalgamation of colors and poorly-chosen fonts. I pushed away my Branding person in favor of my own design choices, and that helped cause the loss. There was also a fundamental idea that we lost sight of: Precision. Our idea was not concise. It could barely be explained in a couple of sentences, and the picture it conveyed was often murkish and shallow. The attention we held waned after the first five sentences of explanation.

    "body": "2018/12/31 - For the full code repository, see here What is The2018Thing?: The2018Thing is the collection of programs that controls the L&amp;N STEMpunks Robot, QBit. QBit was built for the 2018 game FIRST Power Up. (see more details in this video) It creates a driveable 6-wheel chassis, with the capability of PID, autonomous control, and turn control. In addition, it powers the picking up mechanism that you can see in the picture above. What is The2018Thing made in?: The2018Thing was written in Python3, using the RobotPy library. Python is not an officially supported language by FIRST, but RobotPy is a community-made wrapper of the C++ code that is updated regularly and is very stable. The Programming Team (Cade Brown, Logan O’Neal, Jessica Motto, and I) created this codebase over the course of the 6-week build season. We experimented with various ideas before settling on the finished product. We did work on some rudimentary vision processing early on in the build season, but not much came of it, especially since our Robot was not able to utilize it in any sufficient way. Code Organization: As a standard L&amp;N STEMpunks project, this repo folllows the Command-Based framework, a technique of separating the robot into passive Subsystems and Commands. Subsystems are the various parts of the robot (mostly collections of hardware), such as the drivetrain, the mechanism, the sensors, and more. Commands are programs that call the subsystems to do things, such as going forward, autonomous commands, and more. PID: Our autonomous programs use a very complex mathematical concept called PID, or Proportional-Integral-Derivative, which uses calculus to follow a setpoint and oscillate towards it. (FYI, at the time of this post, I don’t know anything about calculus) We use the sensor data from our encoders to measure how far we are, and set a setpoint for how far we want to go. This is the backbone for our auto programs, giving us very refined movement capabilities. Normally, the encoders are the linchpin in all of this, and if they don’t work, the robot does not function properly. We also use PID for our drivetrain. Although it sounds strange, when we push our robot forward with two joysticks (one for left wheels and another for the right), we often start drifting. This is caused by mechanical malfunctions that happen as the robot gets used more and more. Our program basically averages the two sides of the drivetrain to allow for straight driving. The final area we use PID is in the area of sensors. As you may or may not know, sensors are not always completely accurate. Due to their sensitivity, they often have noise. For example, encoder values can always change, even if the robot is at a stop. We balance this noise for sensors like the encoders and our gyroscope with PID. Final Thoughts: I learned a few new things while writing this. I learned how to coordinate with other programmers, reach out into the community, while still not being afraid of failing. I’m writing this just a few days before the new build season starts, so I hope to write more of these. "

    "body": "2018/12/26 - Over the past year, I helped design the robot of the L&amp;N STEMpunks for the 2018 FIRST Robotics Competition: FIRST Power Up.  The goal of the game was to place yellow cubes onto “scales” to gain points (field pictured below). Its function is not dissimilar from a mode in various video games, where one team holds one or more points and gains points the longer they hold it. With 15 seconds to go, the robots are supposed to go to the middle and climb to gain extra points. For a full breakdown, see this video.  Unlike the OutReach Bot renders, I instead experimented with camera effects, swapping out textures, and using different materials.  This was the first time I had opened Solidworks Visualize, and I popped the model in with no one the wiser.  As you can probably tell from the coming models, this is a different mechanism than what we ended up with. The reason for this is how the bot performed in competition. This mechanism broke at our first competition, forcing us to play defense, which we were mildly sucessfull at. For more photorealism, I have begun varying the depth of field that the camera has. This will most likely lead to cooler animations for the reveal video. In addition, I swapped out wood textures on the panels, as to remove the repeated photo that I had taken early on in the year.

    "body": "2018/12/19 - It’s E3 2013. Multiple blockbuster games have been revealed. With new franchises such as Watch_Dogs, or new installments in existing franchises like Assassins Creed: Black Flag, the coming years seem packed. That’s when the lights go out and a video plays. It details a world in a crisis, infected from an outbreak on Black Friday. The lights come back on, with one sentence written on the screen: What will it take to save what remains? Like it or not, The Division is a great example of game development, particularly where it can go bad and where it can go good. The game was revealed to the public in 2013, with an intial release date of 2014, but was delayed until March 8th 2016. Through multiple delays, it fell into that strange area of games which have long development cycles, like Beyond Good and Evil 2 or Mass Effect: Andromeda. (which is worth a more in-depth exploration) When the full thing released, it came out to some praise, but many criticisms. As a writer from IGN best puts it:   . . . as full as the world is of eerily beautiful sights to see, it is equally devoid of worthwhile things to do.    Vince IngenitoThe world was beautiful, but there were many inital problems. Random encounters were rare, enemies endless in combat, but the game was fun when the guns went hot. The world was immersive, with nearly every part of the environment reacting to you. Open car doors would close when you touched them, you could give civilians food, and more. As time went on, the Division forged a new path, one that similar shared-world games such as the Destiny Franchise followed. They met with their community and got feedback through the ETF, or Elite Task Force. They added systems that their players wanted, harder PvE experiences, good loot, and more. By the end of 2017, The Division had a dedicated playerbase, one that continually played the new and enriching experiences that Massive rolled out. Whether or not you liked the game, it is impossible to deny that it managed to fix itself. With a sequel on the way, it will be fascinating to see where this franchise goes next. "

    "body": "2018/12/01 -  A couple of weeks ago I ran a bunch of renders on the STEMpunks computer of our new OutreachBot (ORB for short). These had a variety of themes, some of which you will see. The render above this is themed similar to the Black Superman Suit from DC comics. About ORBORB is a bot we created this past year to take with us on outreaches to the community. It has a 4-Wheel Mecanum drive system, which allows it to move side to side as well as forwards and backwards. It was programmed in Python 3 using the RobotPy library. For more details on the programming aspects of this, see various other posts. Next is one follows the color scheme of the Calus’ Selected shader from the video game Destiny 2. It consists of mainly white, gold, and purple.  This one reflects the sort of steampunk theme our Robotics team has, with dark green and gold working together. If you want to see some cool stempunk action, come by our pit when we go to competition. We are in full costume, and so is the robot.  This render fits the color scheme of our team logo, a dark green and white, sometimes in separate positions of power. Since white gussets don’t work well, I have this color scheme: Finally, I have the L&amp;N STEM Academy themed bot, complete with green and yellow colors. This was used at the Fall Showcase this past week in the area of Digital Arts and Design. This was rendered in 4K with a bunch of other robots, which I will showcase later on.  Using These PhotosFeel free to download these photos and use them how you see fit. Upon further request, I can provide the PSD files for the STEM Academy-themed bot. All of these photos were rendered in SolidWorks Visualize and some were edited with Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator. "
